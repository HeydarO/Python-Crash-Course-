8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:

car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)

Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
stored correctly.
